      <description>So&amp;hellip; I made a thing.
DISCLAIMER:
This project is intended only as a learning exercise. Don&amp;rsquo;t use it to take advantage in the game, and don&amp;rsquo;t try it on Blizz&amp;rsquo;s live servers. Automation of gameplay is against the rules, and you could lose your account. Try it on a private server if you wish to see it working.
Having said that, let me start by telling you the motivation behind this idea.</description>

      <title>Windows XP on a Dell Optiplex 380</title>

      <description>What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to enjoy some free time off work? By spending hours working on a dumb old computer!
So, I was in need for an Windows XP era machine to play with some old games source code, and got my hands on this little Dell machine: the desktop version of the Dell Optiplex 380.
Mine is the model on the middle - sorry about the low quality, this is the biggest image that I found.</description>

      <description>So, one of my pet projects is a game engine based on a 3D Software Renderer (that I will post about some other day). One night, while I was working on it implementing an FPS camera, I started getting strange results when moving the mouse.
My development setup for this kind of stuff consisted on a VM running Fedora XFCE Spin, where I would code using CLion, build and execute the program.</description>

      <description>Hey there! Welcome to my website!
I know that this &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; thing is really cliche, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t miss the opportunity :P
Anyway, seriously now! My name is Rodrigo Verdiani (aka Roverdi), and I&amp;rsquo;m a Brazilian developer. You can find more about me on the about section.
On this website I hope to post some stuff that I&amp;rsquo;m currently messing with, but for the moment I&amp;rsquo;m still working on structuring this blog.</description>
