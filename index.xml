&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m currently working at a medium-sized (~900 employees) technology company, where I use React and TypeScript on a daily basis. So far, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked on both a legacy project and a completely new one. Now, let’s talk about a few things:&lt;/p>
&lt;h1 id="things-that-i-liked">Things that I liked&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Working with a team:&lt;/strong> Until now, I’ve mostly worked alone, which can be lonely and stressful at times, since you’re solely responsible for everything—successes and failures alike.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Single responsability:&lt;/strong> I don’t have to worry about areas outside of architecture, design, and development. There are specialists handling DevOps, deployment, QA, and so on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Agile methodology:&lt;/strong> The communication and task tracking make the work environment much more enjoyable.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>TypeScript&lt;/strong>: It&amp;rsquo;s a great addition to JavaScript (more on that later), offering a nice syntax and powerful features. It can be a bit tricky at times, though.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Tailwind&lt;/strong>: Similar to Bootstrap (which I’ve used a lot in the past), it makes the development process a breeze.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Redux/ReactRedux&lt;/strong>: I really appreciate the principles behind its &lt;a href="https://redux.js.org/understanding/thinking-in-redux/three-principles">Three Principles&lt;/a>: single source of truth, read-only state and reducers.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h1 id="things-that-i-didnt-like">Things that I didn&amp;rsquo;t like&lt;/h1>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>JavaScript&lt;/strong>: Coming from the world of strongly-typed languages, I initially found working with JavaScript a bit frustrating. Thankfully, TypeScript is here to restore some sanity.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>shadcn/ui&lt;/strong>: This library feels a bit messy to me, with lots of abstractions and component variations. However, it’s highly customizable and uses Radix under the hood, which provides a nice API for interacting with components.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Orval&lt;/strong>: I generally don’t enjoy tools that automatically generate code, and this one is no exception. It feels like you lose flexibility, and it often makes the code harder to read than necessary.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Overall, it’s been a great experience, and I’m enjoying every moment. I never imagined that I’d be coding in JavaScript and working on frontend development, but here we are — life has a way of surprising us.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>WoW Arduino Fisher</title><link>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/wow-arduino-fisher/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Oct 2023 10:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/wow-arduino-fisher/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;em>So&amp;hellip; I made a thing.&lt;/em>&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>&lt;strong>DISCLAIMER:&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;em>&lt;strong>This project is intended only as a learning exercise. Don&amp;rsquo;t use it to take advantage in the game, and don&amp;rsquo;t try it on Blizz&amp;rsquo;s live servers. Automation of gameplay is against the rules, and you could lose your account. Try it on a private server if you wish to see it working.&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Having said that, let me start by telling you the motivation behind this idea. At some point in my life as a WoW player (almost 12 years now), I began to collect achievements.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Windows XP on a Dell Optiplex 380</title><link>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/optiplex-380-win-xp/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Oct 2023 20:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/optiplex-380-win-xp/</guid><description>&lt;p>What&amp;rsquo;s the best way to enjoy some free time off work? By spending hours working on a dumb old computer!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So, I was in need for an Windows XP era machine to play with some old games source code, and got my hands on this little Dell machine: the desktop version of the &lt;strong>Dell Optiplex 380&lt;/strong>.&lt;/p>

 &lt;h4>Mine is the model on the middle - sorry about the low quality, this is the biggest image that I found.&lt;/h4>
 &lt;/figcaption>
&lt;/figure>

&lt;p>Before I rant about the problems that I had, let me say that I &lt;em>really&lt;/em> like this form factor: it is relatively thin, can be used on the horizontal and has a decent spec (for the purpose I will be using it for, anyway). My machine has an &lt;em>&lt;strong>Intel Core 2 Duo E7500 (2.93 GHz)&lt;/strong>&lt;/em>, &lt;strong>4 GB of &lt;em>RAM&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> and I put a &lt;strong>120 GB &lt;em>SSD&lt;/em>&lt;/strong> on it; it has an &lt;em>DVD drive&lt;/em> and &lt;em>no floppy disk drive&lt;/em> (more on that later).&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>SDL2, VMware, Linux and Relative Mouse Mode</title><link>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/sdl-vm-relative-mouse-mode/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 15:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/sdl-vm-relative-mouse-mode/</guid><description>&lt;p>So, one of my pet projects is a game engine based on a 3D Software Renderer (that I will post about some other day). One night, while I was working on it implementing an FPS camera, I started getting strange results when moving the mouse.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My development setup for this kind of stuff consisted on a VM running Fedora XFCE Spin, where I would code using CLion, build and execute the program. All was working fine until I got to the mouse related code.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Hello World!</title><link>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/hello-world/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Jul 2023 13:00:00 -0300</pubDate><guid>https://roverdiani.github.io/posts/hello-world/</guid><description>&lt;p>Hey there! Welcome to my website!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know that this &amp;ldquo;Hello, World!&amp;rdquo; thing is really cliche, but I couldn&amp;rsquo;t miss the opportunity :P&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Anyway, seriously now! My name is Rodrigo Verdiani (aka Roverdi), and I&amp;rsquo;m a Brazilian developer. You can find more about me on the &lt;a href="https://roverdiani.github.io/about">about section&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On this website I hope to post some stuff that I&amp;rsquo;m currently messing with, but for the moment I&amp;rsquo;m still working on structuring this blog. Besides that, being pretty new to this kind of thing, I&amp;rsquo;m still very shy :)&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>ABOUT</title><link>https://roverdiani.github.io/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roverdiani.github.io/about/</guid><description>&lt;h1 id="hey-there">Hey there!&lt;/h1>
&lt;p>Hey, I&amp;rsquo;m Rodrigo Verdiani, and this is my blog! :D&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;del>twenty-something&lt;/del> Brazilian tech enthusiast, currently working as a frontend developer, specializing in React.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I was born in the countryside of São Paulo, Brazil, about 50 km away from the capital, and grew up mostly with my grandparents. My grandpa was a science teacher and later a programmer for the city&amp;rsquo;s water department. He’s the one who got me into computers and electronics!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>CONTACT</title><link>https://roverdiani.github.io/contact/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://roverdiani.github.io/contact/</guid><description>&lt;p>Feel free to reach me by sending a DM on any of my social networks - you can find the links on the footer of the website.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
