        <p>So, one of my pet projects is a game engine based on a 3D Software Renderer (that I will post about some other day). One night, while I was working on it implementing an FPS camera, I started getting strange results when moving the mouse.</p>
<p>My development setup for this kind of stuff consisted on a VM running Fedora XFCE Spin, where I would code using CLion, build and execute the program. All was working fine until I got to the mouse related code.</p>
<p>For the approach I was taking, we needed to set the mouse to the Relative Mouse mode, by using the SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode() function. According to the <a href="https://wiki.libsdl.org/SDL2/SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode">SDL Wiki</a>, it works like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While the mouse is in relative mode, the cursor is hidden, the mouse position is constrained to the window, and <strong>SDL will report continuous relative mouse motion even if the mouse is at the edge of the window</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When used together with the SDL_GetRelativeMouseState() function, I should have the mouse deltas since the last time the input was read (once per frame). With those values, I could rotate my camera accordingly.</p>
<p>Ok, so it seems that this is exactly what I needed: the mouse should not exit the window and it will continue to report motion even when at the edge of it. Let&rsquo;s see how I implemented that on the code.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void init_display()
{
    // Window creation code
    // ...

    if (SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(SDL_TRUE) != 0)
    {
        // Log the error and exit the program
        return;
    }

    // ...
}

void process_input()
{
    SDL_PumpEvents();
    
    // Keyboard state reading code
    // ...
    
    int32_t x_offset, y_offset;
    SDL_GetRelativeMouseState(&amp;x_offset, &amp;y_offset); // Ignoring the button state for now
    // Do stuff with the relative mouse motion values set by the function
    // ...
}
</code></pre><p>But then I got into troubles. When running this code for the first time, with a little touch on the mouse, the camera went crazy. It seemed to me that the sensitivity of the mouse motion was too high; I then proceeded to multiply those two variables by a scaling factor in an attempt to correct that - it didn&rsquo;t solve the issue, but made the movement slower, which allowed me to discover another problem: when the mouse cursor seemed to reach the border of the window, the movement stopped completely. Well, there was something clearly wrong.</p>
<p>I was not sure if the camera rotation code was correct, so I hacked a simple test using keyboard input and it worked flawlessly. Ok, then I was sure that the values I was getting from the mouse state were wrong somehow. To verify that, I put a simple debug printf on the process_input() function:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void process_input()
{
    // ...
    
    int32_t x_offset, y_offset;
    SDL_GetRelativeMouseState(&amp;x_offset, &amp;y_offset); // Ignoring the button state for now
    printf(&#34;Mouse motion: X: %d Y: %d\n&#34;, x_offset, y_offset);
    
    // ...
}
</code></pre><p>Which returned me values such as:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Mouse motion: X: -34 Y: 142
Mouse motion: X: -34 Y: 214
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 0
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 142
Mouse motion: X: -34 Y: 214
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 71
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 0
Mouse motion: X: -34 Y: 71
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 0
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 72
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 0
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 0
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 0
Mouse motion: X: 0 Y: 0
</code></pre><p>Given that the camera_rotate() function that I was using expect values in degrees, those values were really greater than what it should be for it to work properly. Moreover, those <em>X:0 Y:0</em> lines where printed when the mouse was on the edge of the screen and I was still moving it.</p>
<p>With a quick search on Google, I managed to <a href="https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL/issues/1116">find an issue on the SDL GitHub</a> that seemed related to the problems I was having. There was an statement from Sam Lantinga (the SDL creator) on it, which said:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>You also can&rsquo;t reliably test relative mode in a VM, which is one of the reasons I haven&rsquo;t gotten to it yet. :)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Hm, so could the problem be the virtual machine? I didn&rsquo;t have any Linux box on hand to try the code, so I ended up porting the source and built it on the Windows host. After solving some issues related to the porting process, I ran it. And it worked perfectly, no issues whatsoever. Here is the output of that printf() debug line:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>Mouse motion: X: -2 Y: 1
Mouse motion: X: -3 Y: 2
Mouse motion: X: -3 Y: 1
Mouse motion: X: -2 Y: 1
Mouse motion: X: -3 Y: 2
Mouse motion: X: -3 Y: 2
Mouse motion: X: -2 Y: 2
Mouse motion: X: -2 Y: 2
Mouse motion: X: -2 Y: 2
Mouse motion: X: -2 Y: 4
Mouse motion: X: -2 Y: 4
Mouse motion: X: -1 Y: 2
</code></pre><p>Notice how smaller the values are. It works just fine with the camera_rotate() function that I made, and the only times I got the <em>X:0 Y:0</em> results were when the mouse was completely still.</p>
<p>Some days later, having some time away from work, I built a Linux box with some pretty old parts I had laying around, and installed the same version of Fedora and the tools I was using, and built the source code. Just like the Windows machine, absolutely no errors; this made me pretty confident that the problem was indeed with the virtual machine.</p>
<p>On that GitHub issue that I talked about, there was a workaround that seemed to work for someone, but I had no luck on getting it to work. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25576438/sdl-getrelativemousestate-strange-behaviour">It consisted of setting an SDL Hint</a>, like this:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>void init_display()
{
    // Window creation code
    // ...
    
    SDL_SetHintWithPriority(SDL_HINT_MOUSE_RELATIVE_MODE_WARP, &#34;1&#34;, SDL_HINT_OVERRIDE); // the workaround
    if (SDL_SetRelativeMouseMode(SDL_TRUE) != 0)
    {
        // Log the error and exit the program
        return;
    }

    // ...
}
</code></pre><p>When I tried it, it didn&rsquo;t change the behavior of the program at all. For the time, I just gave up on getting this to work on the VM, and moved the development to the Windows host. Maybe someday I will try to fix this again, but, given that it works on real hardware running Linux, I&rsquo;m not that concerned.</p>
<p>If anyone has any suggestions to this problem, I would love to know.</p>
